## Purpose of the project

Colin McHenry wanted to devise a way for multiple people to do data segmentation at the same time on the single data set. This project is a working prototype of multiple people (students, staff) being able to segment data concurrently. It uses 3D Slicer and is currently utilising MASSIVE as the host platform. 

It runs under a shared directory and currently uses a random 4 alpha-numeric character string as an identifier. This would ideally be changed to a student's ID or authcate in a classroom setting.
